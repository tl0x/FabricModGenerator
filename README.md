# FabricModGenerator

A small program to allow you  to easily generate fabric mods.

Most of the code was taken from [**GeneratorFabricMod**](https://github.com/ExtraCrafTX/GeneratorFabricMod) 
and [**TemplateMakerFabric**](https://github.com/ExtraCrafTX/TemplateMakerFabric). I made this program they were outdated and aren't being maintained.
