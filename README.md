# FabricModGenerator

A small program to allow you  to easily generate fabric mods.

Most of the code was taken from [**GeneratorFabricMod**](https://github.com/ExtraCrafTX/GeneratorFabricMod) 
and [**TemplateMakerFabric**](https://github.com/ExtraCrafTX/TemplateMakerFabric). I made this program as they were outdated and aren't being maintained.

### Planned Features:
- Quilt and Mojmap support
- Probably some common dependency options (ARRP, Some other libs)

## Installation

1. Download the [**release**](https://github.com/tl0x/FabricModGenerator/releases/tag/releases)
2. Unpack the folder where you want
3. Add the bin folder to your PATH variable.

##### Windows:

- Search Environment Variables in your search menu.
- You should open System Properties. Press the Environment Variables in the bottom right.
- Select Path in the System Variables section and press Edit.
- Press new and add your path. (Linking to the bin folder)

##### Linux/Mac:

##### Run this command.
```
$ export PATH=$PATH:/your/path/FabricModGenerator/bin
```

## Usage

Open a terminal and type FabricModGenerator. You will go through a series of prompts and it will generate the mod. You can use the arrow buttons to navigate through the process. Once you have filled out all the prompts, it will generate a mod. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaeijUEeSNE) is a video demonstration.
