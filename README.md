# FabricModGenerator

A small program to allow you  to easily generate fabric mods.

Most of the code was taken from [**GeneratorFabricMod**](https://github.com/ExtraCrafTX/GeneratorFabricMod) 
and [**TemplateMakerFabric**](https://github.com/ExtraCrafTX/TemplateMakerFabric). I made this program as they were outdated and aren't being maintained.

### Still in development.


## Installation

1. Download the [**release**](https://github.com/tl0x/FabricModGenerator/releases/tag/releases)
2. Unpack the folder where you want
3. Add the bin folder to your PATH variable.

##### Windows:

- Search Environment Variables in your search menu.
- You should open System Properties. Press the Environment Variables in the bottom right.
- Select Path in the System Variables section and press Edit.
- Press new and add your path. (Linking to the bin folder)

##### Linux/Mac:

##### Run this command.
```
$ export PATH=$PATH:/your/path/FabricModGenerator/bin
```

## Usage

Open a terminal and type FabricModGenerator. You will go through a series of prompts and it will generate the mod in a file named *modout*. Please rename this folder or it will throw an error when generating files in the same folder. I will change this in the future.
